  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    An example content implementation guide that illustrates a CQL-FHIR approach to
    knowledge engineering applied to Pathogen Genomics
  </p>
  <p>
    The concepts were abstracted and expressed using Experimental Pathogen Genomic FHIR profiles and
    approaches, with the goal of illustrating how shareable libraries of clinical knowledge
    can be used in pathogen genomic domain including quality measurement and decision support for public health
